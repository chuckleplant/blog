    <h1>I'm Sergio Basurco, software developer and blogging noob</h1>
	<p>Say I just learned something useful and I want to always remember it. I know, I will just use my magic wand and drop it into my Pensieve...</p>
	<p>Wait, Harry Potter is not real?</p>
	<p>Then I guess I'll just blog. About software, mostly.</p>
