I'm quite enjoying photography lately and I just wanted a place to dump a small collection of my favorite snaps. If you open any of the pictures you'll see a small description of what's captured.

> The description is actually embedded in the EXIF metadata of the image and there's some code that generates the HTML for each photo.
