I'm Sergio Basurco, game developer.

I've specialized as an animation programmer, I've spent most of my gamedev career crafting locomotion systems and animation related code. I'm currently back home working at Smilegate Barcelona making AAA games.

Before that I worked at Tequila Works and shipped Gylt, I also worked in undisclosed titles.

Before that I was creating next-gen experiences for video surveillance. I also worked with touchless interfaces for neural networks (actual brains) visualization.

In my free time I both create small pieces of 2D art and study the intricacies of game programming/design.

This is my portfolio and creative getaway.
