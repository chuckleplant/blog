I'm Sergio Basurco, a software developer based in Barcelona.

I'm currently creating next-gen experiences for video surveillance. I was previously working with touchless interfaces for neural networks (actual brains) visualization. I'm interested in all there is. Fond of c++ and recently in a relationship with python.

Future goals are videogame development and philantropic endeavours. Hopefully both.

This blog is about things I couldn't easily Google, other than that you can expect anything.
