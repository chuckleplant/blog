I'm Sergio Basurco, game developer.

I recently moved to Madrid pursuing my carrer in the games industry. I'm now part of the Tequila Works team, makers of RiME and other tasteful titles.

Before that I was creating next-gen experiences for video surveillance. I also worked with touchless interfaces for neural networks (actual brains) visualization.

In my free time I both create small pieces of 2D art and study the intricacies of game programming/design.

This is my portfolio and creative getaway.
