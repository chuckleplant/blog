> To Jennifer, with love.

This image appears within a long scene in which Chihiro takes a train. The scene gives the viewer a break and portrays the protagonist's journey from childhood to adulthood.

This shot appears for just a few seconds. It's a beautifully composed image that instantly takes you in and leaves you wondering.

A small cozy house in a lonely island. In the foreground we see a very welcoming scene, while in the back some dark clouds are creeping in. In the horizon, darkness and light meet separated by a very thin line.
