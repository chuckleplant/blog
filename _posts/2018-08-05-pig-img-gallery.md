I used the jekyll image gallery from aerobless for my image albums. That code used [Miro Mannino's Justified gallery](http://miromannino.github.io/Justified-Gallery/) to show thumbnails of the pictures.

Notes on pig gallery.

* No jekyll integration
* JS api, i don't know much js but it's not hard
* requires several image sizes (lots of space?)
* Maybe just the 20px, a thumb and the original

photo_dir added to config yaml
exiftag dir also the same to config yaml
