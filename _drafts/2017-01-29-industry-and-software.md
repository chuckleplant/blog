(intro
- Compare hardware and software
- what i'm telling here
)
I recently learned what it is about software that made it hard to grasp, it has too many edges and it's a different thing for two different companies. Even if you have two companies making a similar program, the procedure might be completely different.

In order to understand the nature of software development, what helped me was a comparison between software products and hardware products. Hardware products are old, and it's to be expected that with the years comes knowledge and expertise. Software is new, but spreads quickly. If evolution tell us something about this is that we'll have some weird mutants before we can have a well defined specimen or methodology.

##What you see is what you get

Early on, people tried to apply hardware production chains to software. We have an idea, design the product, make the blueprints, build it, test it works and sell it. So that's exactly what we did. Behold the [waterfall software model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model). This is the one I learnt during my years in university. I actually thought that's how all companies would be making software, because why would you not?

##Big fish

Here's what I could see. Giants in the industry are by definition the leading force. In the early years those were the ones making hardware. It's a no brainer, they applied the methodology they knew to the products they did not know. The thing is it works. I can't say the waterfall methodology is not a good one.
