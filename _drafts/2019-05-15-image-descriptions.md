This is another meta-post. I wanted to have an album page to display a few hand picked images. I also wanted to have a little description underneath each photo.

So far my site is generating a separate HTML page for each photo, showing information about the camera and the lens that was used as well as the map (if GPS information is embedded). I just needed to take it a little step further and use another EXIF field for the descriptions.

Luckily there's the *User Comment* tag.

Just use the user comment exif section. See what's the length limit if any.
