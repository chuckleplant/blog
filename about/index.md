I'm Sergio Basurco, a software developer based in Barcelona.

You probably already know how blogs work. If I find anything interesting I might post it here. My first rule is not writing about things that can be easily googled. If you feel like you're wasting your time here, that's totally your fault.

I'm currently creating next-gen experiences for video surveillance. I was previously working with touchless interfaces for medical environments. I'm interested in all there is. Fond of c++ and recently in a relationship with python.

Future goals are videogame development and philantropic endeavours. Hopefully both.
